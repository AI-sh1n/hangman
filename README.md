# Hello-

Hello, let me introduce myself! 
I'm Shin.
I live in Tokyo now, but I’m from Nara originally and mainly raised in Osaka.
I have worked in a variety of professions these last few years; from  CAD operator to shodo teacher. 
If you want to know about shodo, ask me.
If you know about coding very well, please let me know.
And now I’ve started learning python in Sep 2019 to become a data scientist.
I like animals, chocolate, exercising, watching figure skating!
My favorite phrase is ‘Study lifetime, youth lifetime.’
That's about it. Thank you.
